            "content": "Awash Bank SECTION | INTRODUCTION 1.1. Background IFB is a type of modern banking activity which is consistent with few basic financing principles required by the Islamic sharia, which universally prohibits the payment and/or acceptance of interest (Riba) on money, whenever one is engaged in financings of or investing in businesses or for providing services and/ Or limits any one involving in activities and contractual agreements that are not sharia-compliant (Haram). It is comprehensive alternative Banking scheme to the existing Banking operations. IFB operation has been operational in Ethiopia before 8 years, since Oct 2013 by Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and followed by Oromia Bank in Dec 2013. Taking it as one of the best opportunity to mobilize funds from those unbaked segments, most of the Ethiopian Banks, in addition to those mentioned above, followed suits. Awash Bank was not lagging behind with this regard, as it prepared complete set of documents required by the regulatory body to offer the IFB services timely. Those prepared documents were submitted, for further evaluations and permissions, to the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) who critically looked into the documents and examined the operational capacity of the Bank to offer the services. In December 2014, the NBE authorized Awash Bank to conduct the Interest-Free Banking businesses in Ethiopia, targeting those customers who are either un-banked and/or not satisfied with the existing banking services and practices due to their uncompromised religious reasons. ** Accordingly, some of the major IFB products and services for which Awash Bank was authorized by the NBE to offer to its esteemed customers include; - IFB Deposit mobilization scheme (Wadiah Savings, Wadiah Current, Mudarabah Savings (Investment accounts) and IFB Financings schemes (Mufabaha, Musharakah, Salam, Istisna i, Ijarah (Leasing) along with Kafalah (Guarantee IFB. 3).and various trade services through Interest Free Banking Operations Procedure Manuat Page 1"

Though authorized to operate, for the time being, the Bank is not offering Musharakah, Salam and Istisna ! financings due to certain legal and regulatory constraints related to them, absence of proper core banking to support their operations, high degree of risks attached to them and their respective operational complexity from legal, regulatory body and Shariah perspectives. Hence, the implementation scope of this IFB procedure manual is limited only to those products offered by the Bank (both Deposit and Financings). In order to keep bank-wide operational consistency and make sure the manual s user- friendly, the Operational aspects for IFB s deposit mobilization products are prepared in line with the operational points listed under section 2 to 10 in the Bank s Branch Operation and Cash Management Procedure , dispatched from the CEO s office under circular # 01/2017, dated February 27/2017, to all major functional organs of the Bank. Similarly, while preparing (revising) operational procedures for IFB Financing schemes (Murabaha, Qard (Interest-Free Export Financing facility), Kafalah, Hiwalah, Trade Services...), basic Credit operation inputs were taken from the currently in-use Bank s Credit Operations Procedure Manual. |n addition to this, herein above, but, as there are significant number of new issues and peculiar product features due to Shariah requirements, best practices from international Banks (from exposure visits), local banks as well as international IFB standards from Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI) have been taken into account. Despite basic considerations from both Bank s procedures mentioned above, there are some key omissions from, additions to and exceptions in, where necessarily required so by Shariah principles - this IFB operational manual."

In addition, changes from regulatory body (authorizing an opening of full-fledged IFB Banks); there is a need to address new changes related to the newly acquired (to be upgraded) IFB core banking solutions; there are many new IFB products introduced, which were not covered by the old IFB procedures. In conclusion, there is a need to incorporate many changes related to the newly revised Organizational structure of the Bank as well as the previously introduced IFB business operating model (having full-fledged IFB branches and authority decentralization to regional offices), and there is a need to properly and effectively address the financing demand of IFB customers in line with the new business and operating model. Now, therefore, the existing IFB operational procedure is hereby revised. 1.2. Objectives of the IFB Operations Procedure Manual The main objectives of having separate IFB procedure for the aforementioned products and services may include, but not limited to the followings: Clarifying and guiding the IFB business operations of the Bank in the ie ] standardized, uniform and precise manner, b) Defining clear roles and responsibilities of those parties who involves in the IFB Operations, c) Creating common understanding across the Bank s functional units, and d) Delivering the most efficient and Shariah-compliant services to esteemed customers of the Bank by meeting expected service quality level and thus, winning the market competitions with regard to IFB wing.

However, if an existing borrower requested the Bank to convert Bank s loan into that of IFB financing, such request will be entertained through Hiwalah principle, i.e, IFB will settle all outstanding principal amount of the Bank s loan on behalf of the customer while simultaneously booking the Murabaha financing (cost + profit) to the customer. To this end, the customer will settle interests and any arrears payment of the Bank by itself. In case of IFB Financings early settlements, the Bank may give back Hibah, which will be less than or equal to the unearned profit amount, to its early settler customer. The Hibah amount to be re-refunded will be calculated and verified by the branch resident Auditor, requested in written by the Branch manager and authorized by the IFB D/Chief Officer so that the branch will credit it back to the customer s account only at the end of that fiscal year, not later than 25th of June by debiting Hibah Expense Account. Notwithstanding the above point, if the early settler is an NGO staff or Awash Bank s own staff, the branch will collect proportional profit only, accrued as at repayment date, without penalty. Example: If the 10 years IFB financing is to be settled within three years, the three years Murabaha profit will be applied on the Asset cost and then, settle the outstanding amount. All Regional Financing Committees can consider Murabaha financing approval of up to three years only, above which will be considered at those Committees at H.O level.

All branches will forward in writing the detail profiles of the beneficiaries screened by the ad-hoc committee, supported by signed minutes. Instead of publicizing the facility widely, pursuing observation and reference- based selection approach is preferred to avoid request overloading vis-a-vis budget constraint. Character and integrity of a candidate for such financing should be endorsed by other trusted witnesses or cross checked against independent third party references. Even though, target groups are poor & not expected to offer collaterals in order to get Qard-al-hassan financing, the collateral requirement is not totally ruled out.

Mainly, there are two major LC processes: LC at sight and at deferred payment. 9.1. Basic Shariah non-compliance issues observed in current LC operations: a) Some of the major actions of two banks (issuing and negotiating) that are the main ones in the LC process, are areas of concern for Shariah non-compliances. b Pursuant to (a) hereinabove, if the issuing bank opens an LC at sight, which permits immediate (spot) payment to the supplier (beneficiary) upon presentation of specified documents, whereby, there is neither credit nor loan involved, the existing bank procedures are Shariah-compliant and acceptable. c) Pursuant to (a) hereinabove, however, if the bank opens a deferred payment LC, which usually allows payment to be deferred by 60 or 90 days or even longer period, there are critical Shariah non-compliance issues that conflict with the requirements of IFB, like pertaining to the payment term. d Pursuant to (c) herein above, during the deferred periods, the bank usually levies charges and interest on the customer by considering the facility as loans, which is not acceptable by the JFB rules.

Introducing changes that will bring it in compliance with the Shariah principles while working on the common grounds with the existing (without completely replacing the existing LC) - areas where the LC is not in conflict with Shariah laws; 2.
