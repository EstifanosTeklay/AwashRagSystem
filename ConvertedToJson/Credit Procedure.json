In particular, it has been established empirically that the age of a firm is a good proxy for its repayment reputation. b) Capital: The equity contribution of owners and its ratio to debt (leverage). These are viewed as good predictors of bankruptcy probability. High leverage suggests a greater probability of bankruptcy. c) Capacity: The ability to repay, which reflects the volatility of the borrower s earnings. If repayments on debt contracts follow a constant stream over time, but earnings are volatile and there are times when the firm s capacity to repay debt claims is constrained. Collateral: In the event of default, a banker has claims on the CQ. 7 collateral pledged by the borrower. The greater the priority of this claim and the greater the market value of the underlying collateral, the lower the exposure risk of the loan. e) Cycle (or Economic) Conditions: The state of the business cycle is an important element in determining credit risk exposure, especially for cycle-dependent industries. For example, industries that have exposure to international competitive conditions tend to be cycle-sensitive.

There is always an inherent risk in lending, especially over a relatively longer period of time. Besides, no bank can claim that all its loans and advances will be performing portfolio. Therefore, the need for security to safeguard a bank against unforeseen credit risk is clear. 6.1.2 The Bank in principle follows cash flow based lending. The primary protection against losses is the ability and willingness of the customer to repay the borrowing/s from business operations. Therefore, in making credit decisions the bank is guided by the viability of the business it finances rather than by the sole criteria of collateral. 6.1.3 Collateral shall be considered as one of the risk mitigating factors after proper analysis/appraisal of the credit proposal. Hence, collateral shall never be a substitute for creditworthiness, which is the source of cash flow to repay the loan. 6.1.4 However, in situations where there are weaknesses in the viability of a credit proposal from analytical point of view, supplementing collateral for financing a credit proposal might be considered. 6.1.5 In addition to the viability of a business, the experience, capacity, and integrity of the borrower must be seriously looked into. It must be noted that it is not the bank s intention to recover its advances from sale of collateral, but essentially from revenue the business generates. 6.2 Attributes of Good Collateral Movable or immovable assets to be offered as collateral shall be those which are readily marketable, accessible, and relatively stable in value, easily transferable, functionally versatile, and insurable.

It should be noted that without this essential attribute the security backing a loan would be worthless. 6.2.2 Stability of Price a) It is not only enough for lending officers to ascertain the value of a particular security, but he/she should also satisfy him/herself that the value does not fluctuate widely over a short period of time. b) Securities that are subject to wide variations in prices over a short period must be accepted only with high margin. Similarly, depreciated values of movable assets should be seen in relation to outstanding balance of the loans they back, and additional collateral should be requested where the depreciated/market value of the movable assets are considered to be inadequate. 6.2.3 Durability A security should reasonably be durable. Perishable commodities do not serve the purpose of security for a bank loan. Likewise, securities that require special care in handling or storage should also be avoided as much as possible. 6.2.4 Transferability of Ownership A security title, which can easily be ascertained and transferred with minimum formality and expense, is another desirable attribute. The title must be clear and undisputed and should be free from prior encumbrances or charges. 6.3. Types of Collaterals a) Collaterals which are acceptable and can be registered with a legally empowered registrar, include real properties (premises, buildings and houses), motor vehicles, construction and agricultural machinery, and other corporeal elements of business entities.

The key focus of Branches/Relationship Managers should always be on full regularization or reduction of arrears through collections, not on waivers and rescheduling.

Various economic and business level factors can adversely influence the repayment capacity of borrowers. 10.1.2 The implications of bad and doubtful debts on the Bank are many including, but not limited to: a) The Bank shall be forced to hold more provisions. b) Profitability will be hampered since interest income will be placed on non - accrual status. c) The Bank's liquidity position will be affected, i.e., difficulty of meeting statutory liquidity requirements and prompt payments of depositor's funds. [oy The lending capacity of the Bank could be hampered entailing loss of income. As bad and doubtful loans leave a bad scar on reputation of a bank, serious 2 attention should always be given to timely loan collection. 10.2 Handling of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) 10.2.1 Branch Managers/Relationship Managers should seek workout strategies before loans fall under non-performing category. But, if loans fall under non- performing category, Branches/Relationship Managers should not hold the case unattended without taking the necessary actions. 10.2.2 If loans and advances fall under non-performing loans, it should be paid in cash or renegotiated as per the NBE s Directive based on the cash flow capacity of the borrower, and if there is no hope for amicable settlement, the case has to be presented for immediate foreclosure/legal action. 10.2.3 Non-performing loans must be categorized in accordance with NBE's Directive, and be reported periodically (monthly).

One of the techniques is customer grading which is classifying customers (borrowers) in to different risk categories based on the relative magnitude of risk they pose to the bank. Customers under the different risk category are, then, subjected to appropriate credit follow up, management and credit pricing commensurate with their respective risk category. Credit customer risk rating is an important risk management tool as it helps to identify, measure and control credit risks from the outset. It also paves the way for attaching corresponding returns to the level of risks a bank exposes itself to as a result of lending to a client. Credit customer risk rating is concerned with the identification and measurement of risk from individual borrowers at account level and provides important information in risk management. An equally important task is the application of proper information system in managing the risk and determining the amount of income that must be earned from such transactions. In other words, credit customer risk rating by itself does not serve the intended purpose unless the result is properly utilized. Notwithstanding its important role in risk management, credit customer risk rating is not, however, a perfect or error-free technique. It has its own weaknesses as a number of qualitative data are used to explain the conditions of variables related to personal behavior of clients, their management practice and the market in which their business operates. The qualitative data are converted to quantitative figures to reduce their Credit Onerations Procedure Manual . vn ee? Page 120"

To pave way for the allocation of resources to be financed and possible losses of defaults, To craft future policies and strategies for better management of credit risks. To ensure that credit decision will clear out the subjective elements and sentiments in the credit process. To ensure that our customer recruitment and acquisition, extension and retention activities do have multiple factor analysis where in our decisions will be free of biased single factor and sentimental orientations. 13.3 Scope of the Rating The scope of the customer risk rating is limited to and is applicable in the following areas; 13.331 All customers, including new applicants, which are running established business hose requests are above Birr five and in operation for at least one year- million.

The central index card should contain the storage number, the customer s name, date of the file pruning and the dates covered. 14.2.5When the loan account is closed, the offices handling loan documents must complete an index card with the following information; a) Customer s name and address, b) Number of relevant files, c) Period covered, d) Date last account closed, and e) Storage number allocated to the closed file, etc. 14.2.6 This index card should be stored in an alphabetical sequence and reviewed annually by the Credit Administration Unit, Regional Office and Branches.
